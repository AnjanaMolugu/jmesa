===== Where is the autoIncludeParameters feature of eXtremeTable? =====
JMesa is now a form component more like an input or select field. It
is not automatically included in a form tag. It also does not
automatically include parameters. One of the things JMesa tries to do
is be is as straightforward as possible. Coming from the eXtremeTable,
and understanding the autoIncludeParameters feature this may seem like
a step backward, but by not trying to be too smart it increases the
flexibility quite a bit. 

If JMesa is in the same form as your other form fields
then you will not have to do anything as when you submit the form
everything goes with it. If the JMesa table is being used inside a separate form then you would have to have separate hidden form fields that
contain the values from the first form. 

You might think about coming up with a tag that could be used in
conjunction with JMesa that would basically work like the
autoIncludeParameters feature if including separate hidden fields
manually seems like too much work. This would give you the feature,
but be consistent with letting JMesa just render tables. If you look
at the !ParametersBuilder class in the test package it would show you
how the parameters are built. This might even be a good thing to
include in the distribution as an optional tag and be a start to the
tag package.
