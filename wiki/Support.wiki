Because JMesa is in a beta release I would ask that you only check out the project if you are comfortable with finding bugs and submitting issues. I did set up [http://groups.google.com/group/jmesa/topics Google Groups] for JMesa, but I would ask that developers try to help each other out. I will try to be as active on the boards as I can, but for the most part my time is better spent working out the issues. Once we get closer to the release candidates I will be more active on the boards.
