To build a table you first need to create a Limit object to find out how the user interacted with the table. With the Limit you could either use it to do something custom, or manipulate it to throw the table into a different state. With the Limit you then need to create a CoreContext object. The CoreContext allows you to filter and sort the items (Collection of Beans or Collection of Maps). It also gives you access to the Preferences, Messages, and the Limit in other parts of the application. Lastly, you create your View using either one of the factories, or with the components, renderers and editors directly.

The following example assumes you have already followed the [Setup setup] instructions.

Taking things step by step looks like this:
 # Create the [WebContext]
 # Create the [Limit]
 # Create the [CoreContext]
 # Create the View using either the [TableFactory] or [ComponentFactory]
 # Pass the [ViewDataExample view data] to render the table on your [JSPExample web page]
