=== Improvements ===

 * New !AbstractCellEditor that serves as a more logical extension point for custom [Editors CellEditors]. 
  * Remember that when you implement the [SupportInterfaces support interfaces], as included in the abstract class, the JMesa API will automatically inject the key API classes that you need.
 * The exportTypes are enums now. Developers should be using the tableFacade.setExportTypes(!ExportType... exportTypes) enum.
  * Originally I was trying to buffer the API in case more information was useful in the Export object. However that didn't pan out and the current way of working with exports is too verbose with no pay-off. Like always it is backwards compatible and easy to switch over so be sure to switch over as you get time.
  * Example: instead of limit.getExport().getType(); it will be limit.getExportType();
 * Can place some text next to the max rows increments label (in the droplist). Just specify the text in the [Messages].
  * Example: html.toolbar.text.maxRowsDroplist=items
 * Can set global filterable and sortable attributes on the row. Also have the ability to override the row settings on a column by column basis.
 * Better documentation of deprecated methods and the correct method to use.
 * The !TableFacadeImpl throws an !InvalidStateException (runtime exception) if something is set incorrectly. I thought this was a nice improvement to make working with that object easier.
