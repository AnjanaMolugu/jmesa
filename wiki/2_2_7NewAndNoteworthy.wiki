The upcoming features in 2.2.7:

 * New !AbstractCellEditor that serves as a more logical extension point for custom [Editors CellEditors].
 * The exportTypes are enums now. Developers should be using the tableFacade.setExportTypes(!ExportType... exportTypes) enum.
  * I was trying to buffer the API in case more information was useful in the Export object. However that didn't pan out and the current method is too verbose. Like always it is backwards compatible and easy to switch over.
  * Example: instead of limit.getExport().getType(); it will be limit.getExportType();
 * Can place some text next to the max rows increments label. Just specify the text in the [Messages].
  * html.toolbar.text.maxRowsDroplist
 * Can set global filterable and sortable attributes on the row. Also have the ability to override the row settings on a column by column basis.
 * Better documentation of deprecated methods and the correct method to use.
 * The !TableFacadeImpl throws an !InvalidStateException (runtime exception) if something is set incorrectly. I thought this was a nice improvement to make working with that object easier.
