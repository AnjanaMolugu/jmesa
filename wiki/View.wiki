=== View ===

The View interface represents the view package and is used to build your views. The various types of Views are HTML, PDF, XLS, XML and CSV. The two default views right now are HTML and CSV. The other types of views will be built as I get time. 

To build your view you will work with [Components components], [Renderers renderers], and [Editors editors]. A component is either a table, row, or column and defines attributes that are common across all views, regardless of the renderer used. A renderer defines the styling attributes for a specific view and is used to render a component a particular way. Lastly, the editor works with a renderer and defines what the actual data looks like. Editors can easily be used for many different types of views, and then decorated for a specific view.

One huge departure from the eXtremeTable is that each type of view has its own components, renderers and editors now. This is a huge boon for developers as they have max control with how tables are created and allows for maximum reuse.

To help with building views there are quite a few factories that you can use. There is a high level factory [TableFactory] for when your needs are very simple and works by defining just the column names. There is also a lower level factory [ComponentFactory] to build each component separately. Either factory will use their default components, renderers and editors. In many cases the best approach is to use one of the factories to give yourself a jump start, and then swap out the component, renderer or editor that you need. Although, if you find yourself doing this too often you can easily build upon the factories, or just build everything yourself right at the component, renderer, or editor level. I personally find it most useful to use the !TableFactory to build the export views, and the !ComponentFactory to build the HTML view. The reason is most times exported tables are usually not very custom, but HTML tables are.

The View interface is responsible for rendering the markup.
