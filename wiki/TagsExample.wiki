JMesa now has a complete [Tags tag library]! The tags should be very intuitive and is a very similar facade to the [TableFacade]. In fact for exporting you will be using the [TableFacade] to process the export in the controller.

=== Example ===
The following examples uses JMesa, along with Spring. It also assumes you have already followed the [Setup setup] instructions.

==== code references ====
All the code examples are checked into subversion. The best way to present these examples may be to just let you walk through the source code.

 * [http://jmesa.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/jmesaWeb/web/jsp/tag.jsp JSP]
Be sure to pay attention to the [Javascript] page link so that you understand how Javascript is used to interact with the table.

_Once you have your table implemented you can use the !ParametersBuilder to [UnitTest test] your code.
