The JMesa 2.3 release should be out by the end of November. This page outlines the features that will be included as part of the next release.

=== Features ===

 * [Tags Tag library] will include all the attributes from the API.
 * The filter look and feel will be reworked to be more subtle. It will also make use of the [http://jquery.com/ JQuery] !JavaScript library.
 * The filter will include a droplist feature. Again, this feature will be implemented using [http://jquery.com/ JQuery] for the !JavaScript.
 * The State feature will look for the stateAtt in the request scope if it is not found in the parameters. This allows for more flexibility in various frameworks. *(complete)*
 * The most exciting feature will be inclusion of the [Worksheet] functionality!
