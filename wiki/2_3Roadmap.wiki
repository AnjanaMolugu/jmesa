== Features ==
The primary feature will be inclusion of the [Worksheet] functionality!

_A good deal of the features for JMesa 2.3 were released as part of the 2.2.1 through the 2.2.5 minor releases. I did not see any reason to hold on to the changes when developers could be utilizing the features right away._
