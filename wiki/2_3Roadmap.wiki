The JMesa 2.3 release should be out by the end of December. This page outlines the features that will be included as part of the next release. If you are interested in trying out the new features, or just like staying on the bleeding edge of development you can download an [http://builds.jmesa.org/ incremental build]. You will be able to use this page to judge how far along the development is as I will be sure to keep this page current.

*Update*

A good deal of the features for JMesa 2.3 were released as part of the 2.2.2 minor release. I did not see any reason to hold on to the changes when developers could be utilizing the features right away.

== Features ==

 * The most exciting feature will be inclusion of the [Worksheet] functionality!
 * [Tags Tag library] will include all the attributes from the API *(completed)*.
 * The filter will include a droplist feature. Again, this feature will be implemented using [http://jquery.com/ JQuery] for the !JavaScript.
 * Add a getBytes() method on the View to make testing exports easier.
 * Passing in the action invoked string now as the second parameter on the !JavaScript. Could be very useful in custom circumstances. Like any !JavaScript method this additional parameter is optional *(completed)*.

For example this is a custom handling of the sorting that overrides the default behavior and to only allow one column to be sorted at a time.
{{{
function onInvokeAction(id, action) {
    setExportToLimit(id, '');

    if (action == 'sort') {
        var limit = LimitManager.getLimit(id);
        var sortSet = limit.getSortSet();
        if (sortSet) {
            var sort = limit.sortSet[limit.sortSet.length - 1];
            removeAllSortsFromLimit(id)
            limit.sortSet[0] = sort;
        }
    }
	createHiddenInputFieldsForLimitAndSubmit(id);
}
}}}
