Every feature of the eXtremeTable is also in JMesa. In addition there are so many things that we get for free just by the nature of how JMesa is built. 
 * First and foremost we get a clean, clear, consistent API
 * Brand new Limit implementation
   # A Limit can be persisted because all the composed objects are serializable
   # Able to sort, filter, set the page, and set the max rows through the API to throw the table into any state at will
 * Each view is its own table, with its own components, renderers and editors to create highly customized views
 * Javascript Limit implementation instead of hidden form fields which allows for so much more AJAX functionality
 * Plugable filter matching strategies
 * Multi-column sort
