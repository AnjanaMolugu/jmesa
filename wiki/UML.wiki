I spent about 2 months working on the UML to build a table that was soley written from an API standpoint. The result is the UML will be treated like a specification that will not change. I think this is very important because I wanted a well thought out code base that developers could count on. From here there is no limit to how much functionality we can build on top of this.

 * [Limit]
 * [CoreContext]
 * [View]
 * [Test]
