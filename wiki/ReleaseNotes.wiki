===== jmesa-2_beta7 =====

The beta 7 release features a better filtering implementation. Along the way I also decided to re-write the spec to rename the !FilterMatch interface to [FilterMatcher], along with a similar naming convention for the other filtering classes in the core.filter package. The idea is to follow the spec, so doing this is not at all the norm. However, I am now very happy with the flexibility that we have with the filtering. In the next few weeks I will be working on more documentation to demonstrate how to plug in a custom filter, specifically looking at the !DateFilterMatcher class.

I also updated quite a bit of the documentation on the wiki and in the javadocs. Lastly, there are a few more unit tests to help solidify the filtering code.

==== jmesa-2_rc2 ====

The first release candidate introduces the [State] interface. Follow the link to read more about that.

One other major enhancement is the !RowRenderer and !CellEditor rowcount variable can be set to include the pagination in the Preferences. The default is to not include the pagination.
{{{
html.rowcount.includePagination=false
}}}

Lastly, the table row id is now specified for the html view. The format is the table id
followed by the word row and then the correct rowcount. 

{{{
<tr id="pres_row1></tr> 
}}}

==== jmesa-2.0 ====
The 2.0 release is out! There are no changes from the last release candidate so this is just a repackaged version with the correct version number.
