The easiest way to work with JMesa is to create a new [TableFacade] and tweak it however you need to. 

=== Example ===
The following examples uses JMesa, along with Spring. It also assumes you have already followed the [Setup setup] instructions.

In its simplest form you can create a table in two lines of code:
{{{
TableFacade facade = new TableFacadeImpl(id, request, maxRows, items, "name.firstName", "name.lastName", "term", "career");
String html = facade.render(); 
}}}

A more common example is to start with a facade and then do tweak it out and I will show that next.

==== code references ====
All the code examples are checked into subversion. The best way to present these examples may be to just let you walk through the source code. I will work on getting more javadocs in as I get time. The examples only build tables so there is no other code to look at. I am also working on creating a war file, with Jetty built in, that will includes all the source code and examples that can be run locally.

Be sure to pay attention to the [Javascript] page link so that you understand how Javascript is used to interact with the table.

_Once you have your table implemented you can use the !ParametersBuilder to [UnitTest test] your code.
