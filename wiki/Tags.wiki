There has been quite a bit of interest lately in bringing a tag library to JMesa. I think this is a good idea as the API is now very robust. However different developers are wanting different things out of the tag library. What I would like to do is bring the ideas together and build a library that makes sense for JMesa and make it easy to customize to fit other ideas. I also think it is worth exploring making adapters to make it easy for developers that want to move over from other libraries, such as the !DisplayTag or the eXtremeTable.

It is not clear to me yet on how to write up the specifications for a JMesa tag library. However it would be worth starting by putting down what the different tags would be, and the attributes that make sense. The idea would be to make creating tables through the tags very consistent with how JMesa tables are built through the API.

One note I would like to make though is I learned from the eXtremeTable that using a filter to export the table is not a good idea. The support costs are just too high with trying to make it work for different environments. The problem was you had to parse through the JSP file for the sole purpose of generating the table in the correct markup. It is much easier to handle the exports in the controller. However, if you use the new [TableFacade] it makes working with exports pretty trivial.

The following are the tags defined by JMesa.

=== !TableTag ===
|| *Attribute* || *Type* || *Description* ||
|| id || String || The unique table id ||
|| items || Collection || The Collection of beans or maps ||
|| limit || Limit || The Limit object to use ||
|| var || String || The value to hold the current bean ||
|| caption || String || The caption for the table ||
|| theme || String ||  ||
|| exportTypes || String || The comma separated list of exports ||
|| width || String ||  ||
|| style || String ||  ||
|| styleClass || String ||  ||
|| border || String ||  ||
|| cellpadding || String ||  ||
|| cellspacing || String ||  ||

=== !RowTag ===
|| *Attribute* || *Type* || *Description* ||
|| highlighter || boolean ||  ||
|| onclick || String ||  ||
|| onmouseout || String ||  ||
|| onmouseover || String ||  ||

=== !ColumnTag ===
|| *Attribute* || *Type* || *Description* ||
|| property || String || The bean or map attribute ||
|| title || String || The column header title ||
|| filterable || boolean ||  ||
|| sortable || boolean ||  ||
|| width || String ||  ||
|| style || String ||  ||
