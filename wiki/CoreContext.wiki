The !CoreContext encapsulates the core package and is used to Filter and Sort the items (Collection of Beans or Collection of Maps). It also gives easy access to the Preferences and Messages as well as a reference to the Limit. To build the !CoreContext with the factory you need the WebContext and the [Limit], as well as the items.

{{{
public CoreContext getCoreContext(Collection items, Limit limit, WebContext webContext) {
    CoreContextFactory factory = new CoreContextFactoryImpl(webContext);
    CoreContext coreContext = factory.createCoreContext(items, limit);
    return coreContext;
}
}}}

The following shows the !CoreContext interface. This is created with the !CoreContextFactory.

The !CoreContext can sort the items.

The !CoreContext can filter the items. Note: you can specify different filter matching strategies and then plug them in directly on the !CoreContextFactoryImpl implementation.

{{{
CoreContextFactoryImpl factory = new CoreContextFactoryImpl(webContext);
factory.addFilterMatch(key, match);
// TODO: need a better example for this
}}}
