The road map for JMesa is still being defined. However, the general plan is to start with the release candidates as soon as the documentation is more complete. I would also like to get some more unit tests and examples done. I fully expect to have the documentation, unit tests and enough examples done by the end of March. It is undefined as to how many release candidates we will need, but the idea would be to encourage more people to try out the library before going to a final release.
