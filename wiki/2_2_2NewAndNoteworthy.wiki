== Features ==

 * New PDF View implementation (contributed by Paul Horn)
  * You will need the pdf files included in the export-dependencies.zip (available in the downloads area of this site).
 * The State feature will look for the stateAttr in the request scope if it is not found in the parameters. This allows for more flexibility in various frameworks.
 * The exports will default to 'table-data._exportType_' if no caption is specified.
 * Switched to using .gif files instead of .png files as the default. The reason is .gif files did not display correct on IE. The .gif files are included in the distribution so just drag them into your project. I still included .png files as those are easier to customize.
 * Improved look and feel for filter. Now very subtle effect (preview above). 
  * The look and feel changes require an updated jmesa.js and jmesa.css files. In addition with the new jmesa.js file you will need to start using the jQuery library as I utilized that heavily. You can get that at the jQuery [http://jquery.com homepage].

 * Drop Shadow option for table, which gives a nice aesthetic effect (preview above).
  * To make it work put the following script in your code to execute when the page is loaded. Here the imagesPath is the path to your images directory. The following imagesPath in the JMesa web site resolves to '/jmesa/images/table'

{{{
<script type="text/javascript">
	$(document).ready(function() {
	   addDropShadow('${imagesPath}');
	});
</script>
}}}


 * The following Locales are added:
  * Dutch (nl_NL) (contributed by Tom Kalmijn and Marco de Booy)
  * Spanish (es_MX) (contributed by Jes√∫s Morones)

=== Tag Attributes Implemented ===
The following is a list of attributes that exists on the core API and needed to be implemented with the tags.

==== !TableFacadeTag ====
|| *Attribute* || *Type* || *Description* ||
|| messages || [Messages] || The Messages to use. ||
|| preferences || [Preferences] || The Preferences to use. ||
|| columnSort || !ColumnSort || The !ColumnSort to use. ||
|| rowFilter || !RowFilter || The !RowFilter to use. ||
|| toolbar || Toolbar || The Toolbar to use. ||

==== !HtmlColumnTag ====
|| *Attribute* || *Type* || *Description* ||
|| style || String || The css style attribute for the column. ||
|| styleClass || String || The css class attribute for the column. ||

== Bugs Fixed ==
 * If had multiple tables on the same page then tables with no items would display the last row from the previous table. The reason was because the bean as defined by the var attribute was not being cleaned up in the page scope.
 * The State feature persists the current Limit. However, when doing exports this causes the problem of always wanting to export when restoring the State. The solution is if doing an export then will not persist the Limit for the export call. References  [http://code.google.com/p/jmesa/issues/detail?id=35&can=1 issue 35].
 * Toolbar rendering issue (missing title attribute for excel buton). The resource bundle had the incorrect syntax. It should be html.toolbar.tooltip.excel. References  [http://code.google.com/p/jmesa/issues/detail?id=37&can=1 issue 37].
 * Filter on Nullable Property. Fixed by looking at property attribute, and not column data. References [http://code.google.com/p/jmesa/issues/detail?id=36&can=1 issue 36].
